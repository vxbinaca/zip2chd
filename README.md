Converts Zips to CHD files

##Requirements:

- mame-tools for `CHDMAN`

##What is a CHD:
CHD is a lossless compression format originally developed for MAME, for the hard-drive contents of certain arcade machines. It has since been used in several other emulators as a means of storing CD-ROM game data. For CD-based games, it compresses the contents of a disc image (.cue + .bin files) to a single .chd file. Advantages of CHD include single files for games, metadata embedding capacilities, smaller filesize.
